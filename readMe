What is a Data Structure ? 
   * It is a mathematical or logical model of an organizitation of data.In short we can say like, it is a way to organize data in a form that
     is accesible to computer.
   * It allow processing the large amount of data in relatively short period of time.
   * Main purpose of Data Structure is reduce the time and space complexity.
   * An efficient Data Structure use minimum memmory and time to execute.

Types of Data Structure ?
    1)Linear data structure : Linked list, Array, Stack, Queue  - elements arrange in sequential order
    2)Non-Linear data structure : Tree, Graph - They are organized in a hierarchical or graph-like structure.
    3)Hash based data structure : Hash table, Hash map - These are data structures that use hashing to organize and access data efficiently.

Linked List 
    It is a fundamental data structure in computer science.It mainly allow effient insertion and deletion operation compare to array.
    Access the data in sequential, not contiguos like array.

Types of linked list?
    1)Singly linked list
        A singly linked list is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are connected using pointers/links.
        Each node has two parts:
            Data → the actual value (e.g., number, string, etc.)
            Next (pointer) → reference to the next node in the list
    2)doubly linked list 
        A doubly linked list is also a linear data structure,
        Each node has two links instead of one:
            Data → stores the value
            Next pointer → points to the next node
            Prev pointer → points to the previous node
    3)circular linked list
        A circular linked list is a data structure where the last node points back to the first node, forming a closed loop.
            a)Structure: All nodes are connected in a circle, enabling continuous traversal without encountering NULL.
            b)Difference from Regular Linked List: In a regular linked list, the last node points to NULL, whereas in a circular linked list, it points to the first node.
            c)Uses: Ideal for tasks like scheduling and managing playlists, where smooth and repeated.

STACK Data Structure
    A Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.
    LIFO (Last In, First Out), This means the last item you put (push) into the stack is the first one you take (pop) out.
        a)New elements are always pushed on top
        b)Removal (pop) also happens only from the top.
        c)This ensures a strict order: last in → first out.
