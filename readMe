What is a Data Structure ? 
   * It is a mathematical or logical model of an organizitation of data.In short we can say like, it is a way to organize data in a form that
     is accesible to computer.
   * It allow processing the large amount of data in relatively short period of time.
   * Main purpose of Data Structure is reduce the time and space complexity.
   * An efficient Data Structure use minimum memmory and time to execute.

Types of Data Structure ?
    1)Linear data structure : Linked list, Array, Stack, Queue  - elements arrange in sequential order
    2)Non-Linear data structure : Tree, Graph - They are organized in a hierarchical or graph-like structure.
    3)Hash based data structure : Hash table, Hash map - These are data structures that use hashing to organize and access data efficiently.

Linked List 
    It is a fundamental data structure in computer science.It mainly allow effient insertion and deletion operation compare to array.
    Access the data in sequential, not contiguos like array.

Types of linked list?
    1)Singly linked list
        A singly linked list is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are connected using pointers/links.
        Each node has two parts:
            Data → the actual value (e.g., number, string, etc.)
            Next (pointer) → reference to the next node in the list
    2)doubly linked list 
        A doubly linked list is also a linear data structure,
        Each node has two links instead of one:
            Data → stores the value
            Next pointer → points to the next node
            Prev pointer → points to the previous node
